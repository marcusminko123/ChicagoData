# Chicago Data

A repo for Socioecomic indicators in Chicago. This is an edited and repurposed data project from a Coursera I did. 
This data is about the city of Chicago socioecomics, 
public schools and crime. The data is from 2008 to 2012.

The data source is [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2?cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork-20127838&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ&cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork-20127838&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ)

## 1 - Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago

This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.

## 2 - Chicago Public Schools

This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. This dataset is provided by the city of Chicago's Data Portal.

## 3 - Chicago Crime Data

This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. 

This dataset is quite large - over 1.5GB in size with over 6.5 million rows. For the purposes of this assignment we will use a much smaller sample of this dataset which can be downloaded from:<a href="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_SKO/data/Chicago_Crime_Data-v2.csv" target="_blank"> Chicago Crime Data </a>
